== Detailed profile description ==

=== About profile ===

Profile is a system wide evfilter configuration. This configuration is divided
into two parts. First is a profile with set of rules that can match any
specific input device on the system and filter configurations used to load
filters if a match has occured.

=== profilerc ===

File */etc/evfilter/profilerc is a system wide evfilter configuration file.
The file format consits of rules and filenames. The rules are used to match a
specific device or a subset of devices and the filenames are pointing to a
filters configurations.

There are four types of match keywords that map to attributes listed in
*/proc/bus/input/devices* and a *File*  keyword used to load filter
configuration file(s).

==== Matching keywords ====

==== Device ====

Path to the input device in */dev* filesystem. As a matter of fact minor and
major number are compared.

Don't use this unless you really know what you are doing. Paths in */dev*
filesystem are dynamically allocated.

==== Name ====

Device name as it comes from the hardware. Usually something like
*"ImPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse"* or *"AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"*

==== Phys ====

Identifies specific bus or a connector in the computer the device is connected to.

==== Bits ====

Identifies range of events that this device is able to generate. For example relative coordinates.

TODO: this is not correctly implemented yet. :(

==== File ====

File with filter(s) to load when a rule was matched.

The generall syntax of file consist of lines, every line begins with one the
keywords followed by whitespace. The rest of the line till the newline
character is value for that keyword.

When any of rules before the first occurence of *File* keyword is fulfilled,
this file is loaded and filters defined in this file are attached to the list
of filters for this device.

In the following example file mouse.evf will be loaded for mouse connected to
the ps2 connector and file set_keys.evf either for AT Translated keyboards or
for asus extra buttons.

  Phys isa0060/serio1/input0
  File mouse.json
  Name AT Translated Set 2 keyboard
  Name Asus EeePC extra buttons
  File set_keys.json


=== Filter configuration ===

Filter configurations are stored in JSON.

Following example says to load filter name *key_lock* for a key *Enter*.

  {
    "filter": "key_lock",
    "key": "Key_Enter"
  }
